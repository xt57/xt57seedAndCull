# xt57seedAndCull
Seed and systematically cull the contents of an initial Linux install

These scripts and programs are in early attempt to customize any initial, bare metal install of Linux to the user's specifications.

No of this is very special, or clever, code.  It is justa simplistic way to get a script to tailor a bare-metal install to become what the user desires, without have to wait, lookup, or create any commands to do so.

Feel free to clone this code and use it for yourself.

Hopefully, at some point, this can become a more robust and elegant set of scripts and a UI to help aspiring interested users to make the Linux experience more of what they envision.
